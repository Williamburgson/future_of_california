H/T [NYU GovLab Data Collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org/)

This readme aims to provide a common operational picture of public data collaborations in California and beyond! The goal is to build on existing efforts mapping public data (and related) collaborations across the globe including:

- [NYU Gov Lab Data Collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org) -- (from 2015-16ish)
- [Apolitical Global Innovation Labs](https://apolitical.co/government-innovation-lab-directory/)
- [Gov Ex Data Standards Directory](http://datastandards.directory/)

## Future work

This initial exercise is to simply list all the public data collaboratives operating in California. In the future it would be useful to survey key project metadata including a list of partners, number of staff dedicated to the collaboration, the annual budget of the project and other useful contextual information.
