## Open California Mission

The Open California Coalition advocates for useful public data and technology projects that improve the lives of the people of this great state. We're a coalition of Code for America brigades, journalists, local activists, reform groups, and public officials committed to the cause of modernizing how California government operates so the state can lead the world into a more free and open future. 

## Open California Principles

From the world's largest port to the nation's first freeways to pioneering aqueducts, California's history has been defined by visionary public works. The digital revolution has transformed countless industries, yet by and large a time traveler from the 50’s would find the operational practices of California government strangely familiar. 

Nothing equal to the development over a century ago of professional water utilities or universal public schooling — institutions that implemented nearly ubiquitous access to clean water and essentially eradicated illiteracy in America — has been developed for the digital era. California can and should lead the world in building the great public works of our era -- public technology that tackles our big challenges as a state. 

This stems from a belief that California’s open, inclusive values are more important than ever in today’s tribalistic, nationalist times and that California is ideally poised to pioneer digitally native government operations. The following principles are intended to serve as a set of aspirational goals that articulate the promise of public technology and help accelerate the modernization of how California government operates.

1. California should aim to lead the world in ensuring the transformative potential of the digital revolution benefits everyone and that its government reflects the state’s “pioneering spirit.”
2. All of California’s state and local government programs should clearly articulate their intended goals in their public services and use data to measure results achieved.
3. Every state agency and local government in California should make their public data open and machine readable by default. That should include the dollars spent on legacy information technology systems and data detailing all public procurement.
4. California should prioritize standardizing datasets critical to basic public services -- such as parcel level zoning information -- across government agencies to enable collaboration and interoperability across California and around the world.
5. Access to sensitive public data should be streamlined for academic research and shared using industry best practices ethical and secure computational social science. Metadata detailing how and what public data is collected should be made widely available. 
6. All University of California, California State and Community College research should strive to make their work reproducible and lead the world in open scientific practices. 
7. Californians may only be required once to submit and/or update their name, address or other basic information to any California state agency or local government. This already exists in countries like Estonia, and California should strive to lead in this area. 
8. Californians should encounter a seamless user experience when interacting with their government commensurate with the expectation of a modern consumer web application. Digital resources and information should be inclusive, accessible, and useable by the general public. 
9. Public data created by Californians should be stewarded by skilled public technologists and align with the open, inclusive values of this state that welcomes people from around the world to pursue their dreams. 
10. California’s education system should reflect the ubiquity of information and realities of our new economy that highlight the need for lifelong learning. Every California student should have the opportunity for a real world apprenticeship in their profession or area of interest while in public schools. 
11. Every Californian should have access to high speed internet to learn skills and succeed in the rapidly evolving job market. The state should support digital literacy training for all Californians of all ages and continue to improve the connection between online offerings and in person ongoing education programs at Community Colleges. 
12. Californians should have the opportunity to provide official public comment on government business virtually, at a time and place of their convenience, and upvote other comments similar to reddit.
13. This effort to modernize California government should focus on future its people deserve and have the courage to consolidate obsolete institutions that frustrate progress (for example California’s [two duplicative state water agencies](https://lhc.ca.gov/sites/lhc.ca.gov/files/Reports/201/Report201.pdf)). 

## Implementation Strategy

1. California should launch a Civic Technology Corps in the spirit of the Community Conservation Corps and California Conservation Corps. The corps should aim to launch in three months and should place a digitally native, energetic fellow in every government across the state to find specific problems in need of better public technology. That will take approximately ten thousand corps members. 
2. A new California Digital Service should be created to make modern design and information technology practices the new normal in California government. That effort should build from the UK Digital Service, US Digital Service, 18F and numerous other units at cities and countries around the globe. 
3. California should formalize a nonprofit Applied Research arm of the California Government Operations agency to serve as an independent utility stewarding public data across local municipalities and accelerate the implementation of these principles. That effort should build from leading global examples like the UK’s Administrative Data Research Network, the New Zealand Integrated Data Services, and the numerous Data Collaboratives catalogued by NYU Gov Lab. 
4. All California state and local governments should open their doors to new talent with skills in agile software development, data science and other important digital skills. That should include support for training public servants on these new tools and California government managers should actually be able to terminate non-performing personnel. 
5. From start to finish, new government digital service and data science projects should strive to include the community in planning, design, implementation and ongoing maintenance wherever possible. That community involvement should build from existing efforts led by local Code for America brigades and others.
6. Regional and local governments should be incentivized to collaborate and jointly procure technology and services to implement these principles. By aggregating demand and developing standards to meet common needs, California governments can save money while deploying better public technology. 
7. California should empower the Little Hoover Commission with the ability to place proposals to modernize obsolete and consolidate duplicative government agencies as an initiative on the California ballot. This concept was described in greater detail in the Think Long Committee’s “Blueprint to renew California.”
