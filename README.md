This repo exists to help pioneer a brighter future in California and beyond. The [principles articulated here]](https://argo-marketplace.github.io/future_of_california/) aim to accelerate good government through great public technology.

_Context:_ ["The public works of the digital era have yet to be built. The opportunity is huge"](https://apolitical.co/solution_article/public-investment-made-california-great-its-time-for-the-next-wave/)

## Please Contribute!

We're a coalition of Code for America brigades, journalists, local activists, reform groups, and public officials committed to the cause of modernizing how California government operates so the state can lead the world into a more free and open future. 

Please see here for the latest version of the [California Public Technology Principles.](https://argo-marketplace.github.io/future_of_california/) Please feel free to [create an Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) (less technical) OR [submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (more technical) to suggest improvements to the principles.

## Implementation Activity

There is a robust discussion in the [issues of this Future of California repo](https://github.com/argo-marketplace/future_of_california/issues) around creative ideas to implement these principles. 

Also please see the [_CA_data_collaborations_ subfolder](https://github.com/argo-marketplace/future_of_california/tree/master/CA_data_collaborations) for an ongoing effort to map public data collaborations in California and beyond.

As of 12/14/18 there is a NYU CUSP graduate student team focused on pulling data from the GitHub API from government repos in California and beyond. 

More to come! Please share your ideas and better yet share what actions you are taking to pioneer a brighter future for humans in California and beyond.
